# devkit

Getting started:
- git clone
- cd devkit
- optional: download your xldeploy distro in ./distro (if ./distro doesn't contain software, XLDeploy will be downloaded. In that case you will have to set the correct version number in Dockerfile)
- place your license file in ./distro
- ./build-image.sh

# devkit

Getting started:
- git clone
- cd devkit
- place your license file in ./xld/deployit-license.lic
- ./buildimage.sh

Note: this will download the latest version of XL Deploy. If you need another version you'll have to download it yourself and change Dockerfile to use the downloaded version.
